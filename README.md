<h2 align="center">Neutron - DAO</h2>

## Overview

The Neutron governance is based on [DAO DAO](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts) contracts, with some modifications. In addition, we implemented 3 contracts that manage Neutronâ€™s funds.

- **The Neutron DAO.**
- **Multiple subDAOs** Subdao is basically an entity to delegate a control of minor network properties. They're pretty similar to main DAO, but every SubDAO proposal is timelocked for a certain period, during which the main DAO can cancel the proposal via an overrule proposal. 
- **The Treasury** holds the vested NTRNs and sends them to the Reserve and Distribution contracts.
- **The Reserve** contract keeps funds vested from treasury for one-off payments
- **The Distribution** contract is responsible of the second step of token distribution where tokens sent to this contract are distributed between `share holders`, where `share holders` are a configurable set of addresses with number of shares. This contract allows shareholders to withdraw collected tokens.

## Testing 

1. from `neutron` run: `make init`.
2. run `./test_proposal.sh` or  `./test_subdao_proposal.sh`.
3. see that proposal has passed.

There are a number of [integration tests](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-integration-tests/tree/main/src/testcases) to cover main functionality.
