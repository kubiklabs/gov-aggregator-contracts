# Pre-Propose Base

This provides a base package that may be used to implement pre-propose
modules. It is modeled after the
[cw721-base](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/tree/27ffdc6c24c2d173be6c677d04bec1420191184d/contracts/cw721-base)
contract for implementing NFT contracts.

See the
[pre-propose-single](../../contracts/pre-propose/cwd-pre-propose-single)
contract for an example of using this package to implement a proposal
module with deposits.
