### Neutron Lockdrop Voting Vault

This contract is not really a voting vault. It's rather an interface to get voting power from a Lockdrop contract. It's not possible to Bond or Unbond funds to this vault cause these ExecuteMsg handlers are introduced just to make the contract comply with the voting vault interface.
