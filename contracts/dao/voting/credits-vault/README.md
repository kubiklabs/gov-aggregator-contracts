### Neutron Credits Vault

This vault will allow its users to query voting power represented by cNTRN tokens. Just as with normal DAO DAO voting modules, for each specific proposal, you can only use the voting power that was available to you at the time of proposal submission. No additional restrictions are imposed on the vault funds.
