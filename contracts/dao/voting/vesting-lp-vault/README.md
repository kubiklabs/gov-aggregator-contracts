### Neutron Vesting LP Voting Vault

This contract is not really a voting vault. It's rather an interface to get voting power from a Vesting LP contract. It's not possible to Bond or Unbond funds to this vault cause these ExecuteMsg handlers are introduced just to make the contract comply with the voting vault interface.
