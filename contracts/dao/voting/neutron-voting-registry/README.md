Instead of a single voting power module, Neutron DAO core contract interacts with the *Voting Power Registry* contract that keeps track of multiple *Voting Vaults*. There can be many Voting Vault implementations, but at the launch Neutron will only have one vault implementation for bonding native NTRN tokens.
