//! # cw-core
//!
//! This contract is the core module for all DAO DAO DAOs. It handles
//! management of voting power and proposal modules, executes messages,
//! and holds the DAO's reserve.
//!
//! For more information about how these modules fit together see
//! [this](https://!github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/DAO-DAO-v1-Contracts-Design)
//! wiki page.
//!
//! In additon to the wiki spec this contract may also pause. To do so a
//! `Pause` message must by executed by a proposal module. Pausing the
//! core module will stop all actions on the module for the duration of
//! the pause.
