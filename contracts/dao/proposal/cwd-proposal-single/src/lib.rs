//! # cw-proposal-single
//!
//! A proposal module for a DAO DAO DAO which supports simple "yes", "no",
//! "abstain" voting. Proposals may have associated messages which will be
//! executed by the core module upon the proposal being passed and
//! executed.
//!
//! For more information about how these modules fit together see
//! [this](https://!github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/DAO-DAO-v1-Contracts-Design)
//! wiki page.
//!
//! For information about how this module counts votes and handles passing
//! thresholds see
//! [this](https://!github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/A-brief-overview-of-DAO-DAO-voting#proposal-status)
//! wiki page.
//!
//! ## Proposal deposits
//!
//! This contract may optionally be configured to require a deposit for
//! proposal creation. Currently, any cw20 token may be used.
//!
//! As a convienence one may specify that the module should use the same
//! token as the DAO's voting module using the `VotingModuleToken` variant
//! when specifying information about the deposit. For this to work the
//! voting module associated with the DAO must support the `TokenContract`
//! query. This query may be derived via the `#[token_query]`
//! [macro](../../packages/cw-core-macros/src/lib.rs).
//!
//! ## Hooks
//!
//! This module supports hooks for voting and proposal status changes. One
//! may register a contract to receive these hooks with the `AddVoteHook`
//! and `AddProposalHook` methods. Upon registration the contract will
//! receive messages whenever a vote is cast and a proposal's status
//! changes (for example, when the proposal passes).
//!
//! The format for these hook messages can be located in the
//! `proposal-hooks` and `vote-hooks` packages located in
//! `packages/proposal-hooks` and `packages/vote-hooks` respectively.
//!
//! To stop an invalid hook receiver from locking the proposal module
//! receivers will be removed from the hook list if they error when
//! handling a hook.
